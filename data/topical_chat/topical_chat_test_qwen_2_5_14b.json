They're typically about an inch in diameter and are protected by several layers. The outermost layer is made of a strong, flexible material like polyethylene, which helps protect the cable from damage. Inside this layer, there are often additional protective layers, including metal armor and more plastic insulation. The actual fiber optic cables that carry the data are in the center and are incredibly thin.\n\nTo further protect against damage from anchors, fishing equipment, and natural hazards like earthquakes, these cables are often buried under the seafloor in areas close to shore where they're most vulnerable. In deeper waters, they're laid on the ocean floor. There are also monitoring systems in place to detect any disruptions or potential threats to these cables.\n\nIt's fascinating how much technology and engineering goes into keeping our global communications network running smoothly, isn't it?",

Before the 12th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which was ratified in 1804, the Vice President was indeed the runner-up in the presidential election. This meant that the candidate who received the second highest number of electoral votes became the Vice President. However, this system was changed due to issues that arose in the elections of 1796 and 1800, where it led to conflicts and complications in governance. Now, the President and Vice President are elected on the same ticket. \n\nRegarding the \"President Banana\" comment, it seems there might be some confusion. The first president of Zimbabwe was Canaan Banana, who served as the country's first President and Head of State from 1980 to 1987. He was the ceremonial president, while Robert Mugabe was the Prime Minister. Canaan Banana was often referred to as \"President Banana,\" but this wasn't a nickname given due to any particular incident or characteristic; it was simply a play on his name.",

        "generated_reference": "That's correct! Before the 12th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which was ratified in 1804, the Vice President was indeed the runner-up in the presidential election. This meant that the candidate who received the second highest number of electoral votes became the Vice President. However, this system was changed due to issues that arose in the elections of 1796 and 1800, where it led to conflicts and complications in governance. Now, the President and Vice President are elected separately on the same ticket. \n\nRegarding the \"President Banana\" comment, it seems there might be some confusion. The first president of Zimbabwe was Canaan Banana, who served as the country's first President and Head of State from 1980 to 1987. He was the ceremonial president, while Robert Mugabe was the Prime Minister. Canaan Banana was often referred to as \"President Banana,\" but this wasn't a nickname given due to any particular incident or characteristic; it was simply a play on his name.",

Inside this layer, there are often additional protective layers, including metal armor and more plastic insulation. The actual fiber optic strands that carry the data are in the center and are incredibly thin.\n\nTo further protect against damage from anchors, fishing equipment, or natural disasters, these cables are often buried under the seafloor in areas close to shore where they're most vulnerable. In deeper waters, they're laid on the ocean floor.

Inside this layer, there are often additional protective layers, including metal armor and more plastic insulation. The actual fiber optic strands that carry the data are in the center and are very thin.\n\nTo further protect against damage from anchors, fishing equipment, or natural disasters, these cables are often buried under the seafloor in areas close to shore where they're most vulnerable. In deeper waters, they're laid on the ocean floor.

Before the 12th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which was ratified in 1804, the Vice President was indeed the runner-up in the presidential election. This meant that the candidate who received the second highest number of electoral votes became the Vice President. However, this system was changed due to issues that arose in the elections of 1796 and 1800, where it led to conflicts and complications in governance. Now, the President and Vice President are elected on the same ticket. \n\nRegarding the \"President Banana\" comment, it seems there might be some confusion. The first president of Zimbabwe was Canaan Banana, who served as the country's first President and Head of State from 1980 to 1987. He was the ceremonial president, while Robert Mugabe was the Prime Minister. Canaan Banana was often referred to as \"President Banana,\" but this wasn't a nickname given due to any particular incident or characteristic; it was simply a play on his name.",

Inside this layer, there are multiple protective layers, including metal armor and a jelly-like substance that helps prevent water from entering the cable.
