    "informativeness": "1. Identify the key elements within the structured data expression that need to be conveyed in the sentence.\n2. Analyze the generated sentence to see if it covers all the identified key elements from the structured data expression.\n3. Assess the clarity and detail of the sentence—determine if it provides sufficient context and explanation for the information included.\n4. Rate the informativeness of the sentence on a scale of 1 to 3, where:\n   - 1: The sentence contains little to no relevant information from the expression.\n   - 2: The sentence conveys some information but omits important elements.\n   - 3: The sentence describes all pertinent information from the expression clearly and comprehensively. \n5. Document the reasoning behind the assigned rating, referencing specific aspects of both the structured data expression and the generated sentence.",
    "naturalness": "1. **Read the Sentence**: Carefully read the generated sentence to understand its structure and content.\n\n2. **Assess Sentence Structure**: Evaluate the grammatical correctness, including subject-verb agreement, punctuation, and overall coherence.\n\n3. **Evaluate Word Choice**: Analyze the appropriateness of the vocabulary used—are the words suitable for the context? Is there a variety of language?\n\n4. **Consider Flow and Clarity**: Determine if the sentence flows smoothly and if it is clear in its meaning. Does it feel like a part of natural conversation or writing?\n\n5. **Review Context Relevance**: Ensure that the sentence appropriately reflects the structured data expression it is intended to represent.\n\n6. **Rate Naturalness**: Based on the assessment, assign a score:\n   - **1**: The sentence is awkward or difficult to understand; it feels unnatural.\n   - **2**: The sentence is generally clear but may have minor issues that affect naturalness.\n   - **3**: The sentence is well-constructed, flows naturally, and feels appropriate for conversation or writing.\n\n7. **Document Findings**: Record your observations and the final score for reference."
