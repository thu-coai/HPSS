Rate the sentence on a scale of 1 to 10 based on the overall informativeness, considering completeness, clarity, relevance, and conciseness.\n7. Provide a brief justification for the assigned rating based on the evaluation criteria.",
    "naturalness": "1. Read the generated sentence carefully to understand its structure and meaning.\n2. Identify any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that may affect the sentence's naturalness.\n3. Evaluate the sentence for coherence and fluidity; determine if it reads smoothly from one idea to the next.\n4. Assess the appropriateness of vocabulary choices; consider if the words used are commonly used in natural speech or writing.\n5.
