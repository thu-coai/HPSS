    "coherence": "coherence : The extent to which the response is logically connected, clear, and free from contradictions. A response that is well-structured, directly addresses the question or task, and maintains a clear line of thought throughout will score higher. A perfect score of 50 indicates the response is entirely coherent, while a score of 1 indicates the response is incoherent, with ideas that do not connect logically or are difficult to understand.",
    "engagingness": "engagingness : The ability to capture and maintain the interest of the audience through clarity, relevance, and creativity. 1-10: The response is confusing or irrelevant, failing to address the core of the question or topic. 11-20: The response is somewhat clear but lacks creativity or relevance, making it less interesting. 21-30: The response is clear and relevant but does not stand out in terms of creativity or additional value. 31-40: The response is clear, relevant, and shows some creativity or additional value, engaging the audience to a moderate degree. 41-50: The response is clear, relevant, highly creative, and adds significant value, effectively engaging the audience.",
    "groundedness": "groundedness : The extent to which a response is based on facts, logical reasoning, and relevant evidence rather than speculation or unfounded claims. A response that strictly adheres to factual information and logical consistency would receive a high score, while a response that includes significant speculation or lacks factual support would receive a lower score. 0 - 50 points are assigned based on how well the response meets these criteria, with 50 being the highest score for a response that is entirely grounded.",
    "naturalness": "naturalness : The response's fluency and coherence, reflecting how naturally it would be produced by a human. A score of 1 indicates the response is highly unnatural, with awkward phrasing and poor flow. A score of 50 indicates the response is perfectly natural, indistinguishable from human-generated text in terms of fluency and coherence."
