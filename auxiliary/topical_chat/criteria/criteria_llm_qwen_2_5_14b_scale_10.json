    "coherence": "coherence : The response is clear, logical, and well-structured, with ideas flowing naturally from one to the next. A response that is fully coherent, with all parts contributing to a clear and understandable message, would receive a 10. A response that is disjointed, with ideas not clearly connected or difficult to follow, would receive a lower score, potentially as low as 1 if it is almost entirely incoherent.",
    "engagingness": "engagingness : The ability to capture and maintain the interest of the reader or listener, defined by clarity, relevance, creativity, and the use of appropriate tone and style. A response that fully captures interest and maintains it throughout, using all positive aspects effectively, would rate a 10. A response that fails to capture interest or uses these aspects poorly would rate a 1.",
    "groundedness": "groundedness : The extent to which a response is based on facts, evidence, and logical reasoning rather than speculation or unfounded claims. A response that strictly adheres to known facts and logical consistency would receive a high rating (9-10), while a response that includes significant speculation, contradictions, or lacks factual support would receive a lower rating (0-3). Responses that partially adhere to factual and logical standards but contain minor inaccuracies or less critical logical flaws would be rated accordingly in the middle range (4-8).",
    "naturalness": "naturalness : The response's fluency and coherence, reflecting how naturally it would be produced by a human. A score of 10 indicates the response is indistinguishable from human-generated text, with smooth transitions between ideas, appropriate use of idioms and colloquialisms, and a conversational tone when appropriate. A score of 1 indicates the response is stilted, repetitive, or contains awkward phrasing that disrupts the flow of the conversation."
