    "coherence": "coherence : The response is clear, logical, and well-structured, with ideas flowing naturally from one to the next. A response that is fully coherent, with all parts contributing to a clear and understandable message, would receive a high score (90-100). A response that is mostly coherent but has minor issues with structure or flow would receive a mid-range score (60-89). A response that is difficult to follow due to poor structure, logical gaps, or irrelevant information would receive a low score (0-59).",
    "engagingness": "engagingness : The ability to capture and maintain the interest of the audience or user. It involves clarity, relevance, and the use of persuasive or appealing language. A response that is highly relevant, clear, and uses language that is both persuasive and appealing would score closer to 100, while a response that lacks these qualities would score lower.",
    "groundedness": "groundedness : The extent to which a response is based on facts, evidence, and logical reasoning rather than speculation or unfounded claims. A response that strictly adheres to known facts and evidence would receive a high score, while a response that includes significant amounts of speculation or misinformation would receive a low score.",
    "naturalness": "naturalness : The response's fluency and coherence, reflecting how naturally it would be produced by a human. A response that is perfectly fluent, coherent, and indistinguishable from a human's would score 100. A response that is awkward, disjointed, or clearly machine-generated would score lower, with specific deductions for unnatural phrasing, lack of context integration, and failure to maintain a conversational tone."
