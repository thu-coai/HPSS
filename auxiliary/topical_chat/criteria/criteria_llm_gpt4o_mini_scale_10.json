    "coherence": "coherence: Coherence refers to the logical connection and clarity of ideas within a response. A coherent response should have a clear structure, with individual points effectively linking to one another and supporting the main argument or theme. The correspondence between response quality and rating is as follows: \n\n10 - Perfectly coherent, no logical gaps, and very clear.\n9 - Highly coherent, with minimal issues, clear and logical.\n8 - Generally coherent, with few logical gaps; mostly clear.\n7 - Somewhat coherent, with several logical gaps; clarity is affected.\n6 - Marginally coherent, with many logical gaps; difficult to follow.\n5 - Some coherence issues, significantly unclear; hard to understand.\n4 - Poorly coherent, with numerous logical lapses; very confusing.\n3 - Lacks coherence, leading to major misunderstandings; not clear.\n2 - Extremely incoherent, almost unintelligible; ideas are jumbled.\n1 - Entirely incoherent; no logical connection or clarity present.",
    "engagingness": "engagingness : Engagingness refers to the ability of a response to capture and maintain the interest of the audience. It encompasses elements such as clarity, relevance, creativity, emotional appeal, and the ability to provoke thought or stimulate further discussion. \n\nRating Scale:\n1-2: The response is dull and uninteresting, lacking any engaging elements.\n3-4: The response has minimal engagement, with some clarity or relevance but fails to capture interest.\n5-6: The response is moderately engaging; it has some creative or appealing aspects but lacks depth or may be too generic.\n7-8: The response is quite engaging, with strong clarity and relevance, and includes creative or emotionally resonant elements, prompting interest and potential discussion.\n9-10: The response is highly engaging, presenting unique insights, vivid imagery, or thought-provoking content that captivates and inspires the audience.",
    "groundedness": "groundedness: Groundedness refers to the extent to which a response is based on factual information, logical reasoning, and relevant context. A response that accurately incorporates verifiable facts, aligns with established knowledge, and is supportive of its claims demonstrates high groundedness. Ratings are as follows: \n\n0-2: Very low groundedness - No factual basis or context, relies on speculation or unverifiable claims.  \n3-5: Moderate groundedness - Some factual content, but lacks comprehensive support or relevance to the topic.  \n6-8: High groundedness - Well-supported by facts and relevant context, demonstrating a strong connection to established knowledge.  \n9-10: Exceptional groundedness - Thoroughly grounded in factual evidence, comprehensive context, and insightful analysis, leaving no room for ambiguity.",
    "naturalness": "naturalness : Naturalness refers to how closely the response mimics natural, conversational speech. A high-quality response should have fluidity, appropriate tone, and context relevance, as well as avoidance of awkward phrasing or unnatural constructions. A rating of 10 indicates an exceptionally natural response that feels like a seamless part of a dialogue, while a rating of 1 indicates a response that feels severely stilted or ungrammatical, disrupting the conversational flow. \n\nRating scale:\n10 - Exceptionally natural, flows seamlessly \n9 - Very natural, minor issues \n8 - Mostly natural, some awkwardness \n7 - Fairly natural, noticeable issues \n6 - Some natural elements, considerable awkwardness \n5 - Neutral, neither natural nor unnatural \n4 - Some unnatural elements, lacks fluidity \n3 - Quite unnatural, significant phrasing issues \n2 - Very unnatural, difficult to follow \n1 - Severely unnatural, disruptive to conversation"
