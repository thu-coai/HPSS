    "coherence": "Evaluation Steps:\n1. Receive the provided interesting fact and the corresponding response.\n2. Analyze the response for logical structure, clarity, and the absence of contradictions.\n3. Score the response on a scale of 1 to 50 based on its coherence, with 50 being the highest score for perfect coherence.\n4. Provide the score and a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the score.",
    "engagingness": "Evaluation Steps:\n1. Receive the provided interesting fact and the response to be evaluated.\n2. Assess the clarity of the response in relation to the provided interesting fact.\n3. Evaluate the relevance of the response to the interesting fact.\n4. Determine the level of creativity in the response.\n5. Consider the additional value the response brings to the conversation.\n6. Rate the response on a scale of 1 to 50 based on the criteria outlined in the rules, focusing on engagingness.\n7. Provide the final score and a brief explanation of the rating.",
    "groundedness": "Evaluation Steps:\n1. Identify the provided interesting fact and the corresponding response to be evaluated.\n2. Assess the response for its adherence to factual information, logical reasoning, and relevant evidence.\n3. Determine if the response includes any speculation or unfounded claims.\n4. Score the response on a scale of 0 to 50 based on the groundedness criteria, with 50 indicating a response that is entirely grounded and 0 indicating a response that is not grounded at all.\n5. Provide the score and a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the score.",

Consider how naturally the response would be produced by a human, taking into account factors such as sentence structure, vocabulary choice, and overall flow.\n4. Assign a score between 1 and 50 based on the naturalness criteria, with 1 being highly unnatural and 50 being perfectly natural.\n5. Provide the score and a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the score if necessary."
