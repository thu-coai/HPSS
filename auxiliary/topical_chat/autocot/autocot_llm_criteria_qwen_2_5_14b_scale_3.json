    "coherence": "Evaluation Steps:\n1. Read the provided interesting fact and the response to it.\n2. Assess the clarity of the response, ensuring that the information is presented in a way that is easy to understand.\n3. Evaluate the logical structure of the response, checking if the points are presented in a logical and organized manner.\n4. Determine if the response maintains a consistent theme or argument throughout, without introducing unrelated or confusing elements.\n5. Assign a rating based on the assessment, using the scale of 1 to 3 as defined in the rules.",
    "engagingness": "Evaluation Steps:\n1. Read the provided interesting fact and the response to be evaluated.\n2. Assess the clarity of the response in relation to the interesting fact. Does the response clearly convey information about the fact?\n3. Evaluate the relevance of the response. Is the response directly related to the interesting fact, or does it veer off-topic?\n4. Consider the creativity of the response. Does the response offer a unique or novel perspective on the fact, or does it simply state the fact without additional insight?\n5. Determine the overall engagingness of the response based on the clarity, relevance, and creativity assessed in steps 2-4.\n6. Assign a rating on a scale of 1 to 3 based on the engagingness assessment, where 1 is unengaging, 2 is somewhat engaging, and 3 is highly engaging.\n7. Provide feedback based on the rating assigned.",
    "groundedness": "Evaluation Steps:\n1. Identify the provided interesting fact and the corresponding response to be evaluated.\n2. Assess the response for its adherence to known facts and logical consistency.\n3. Determine if the response includes any speculation, contradictions, or lacks factual support.\n4. Rate the response on a scale of 0 to 1 based on the groundedness criteria, with 1 being the highest level of groundedness.\n5. Provide a brief explanation for the rating given, focusing on the groundedness aspect.",
    "naturalness": "Evaluation Steps:\n1. Receive the provided interesting fact and the response to be evaluated.\n2. Analyze the response for fluency and coherence, considering how naturally it would be produced by a human.\n3. Identify any unnatural elements, awkward phrasing, or disjointed parts in the response.\n4. Assign a rating on a scale of 1 to 3 based on the analysis, with 3 being the highest for responses that are indistinguishable from human-generated text and 1 being the lowest for responses that are noticeably robotic or disjointed.\n5. Provide the rating and a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the rating."
